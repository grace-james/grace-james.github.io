                    Here's a little bit about me: My name is Grace
                    and I've recently descovered that I love the zoo.
                    I want a dog but now's not the right time,
                    so I've started visiting the animals at the zoo to get some of my lack of dog related animal time.
                    I am also a big fan of outside and i care deeply about water and those that live in the water.
                    oh yes! and im currently learning to code, this blog will be about that mainly.
