            When starting off on the world of code there are a few places you will likely land first, in the world of
            HTML CSS and javascript. These worlds are what we will explore a little here.

            So, HTML and CSS are commonly used in sentences together as they are usually working together to create what
            you see when you look at a web page. But what's the difference between them? They are quite a pair, they
            have that toxic “you complete me” kind of love story.

            HTML is responsible for all the actual things we see on a web page, text, buttons, links, photos, forms etc.
            These are the most fundamental building blocks of a web page. Now CSS is responsible for how all of those
            things look. Have you ever visited a webpage that you've been to before but now it looks different? now it
            just has an ugly list of links and a little image icon? Well CSS makes sure the page doesn't look like that.
            It makes the website an enjoyable useable experience through styling. HTML can exist without CSS but will be
            pretty undesirable to interact with. CSS on the other hand can not exist without HTML because HTML is the
            platform which CSS is changing to look nice.

            Now that's covered let's take a little trip to Javascript. Javascript is what makes websites seem like
            magic, it's responsible for all of the actions a webpage can do. Like saving and changing information. It
            basically takes HTML and makes it do cool stuff. The special thing it uses to do that is the document object
            model or DOM. The dom lives in the browser and gets sent all the information from the HTML CSS and
            Javascript files. It reads them and sees where the javascript is saying “hay document! Can you please put
            this thing I've created over here into the HTML at this address?” and then the DOM looks up that address in
            the HTML and puts the javascript creation there. There are lots of ways of using the dom including using it
            as a practice ground on the webpage itself, because the DOM has a memory of the files on the browser you can
            use the browser as a sandbox to try new things.


        </p>
        <p>
            Javascript has a way of executing or being read through which is called control flow. Control flow is
            basically just a way of executing the code by reading it from top to bottom. Just like how you might read a
            list of instructions to put a shelf together. There are a few things that can change the way the flow runs,
            for example, loops tell the code to do the same thing over and over again until the desired outcome is
            reached. The desired outcome might be getting to 10, it would stop there in the flow and make sure is counts
            to 10 and then continues on.


        </p>
        <p>
            Javascript has different ways of storing data, Arrays and Objects. An array is like a list, and an object is
            more of a filing system. Inside the object, there could be a person property and inside it can contain a
            bunch of information about that person like their name, age and address. To access the data in arrays you
            use a number system starting with zero. For example, If you have a list with 4 things on it, to get the
            first thing from the list you would write list[0]. To access data in objects there's more to specify and for
            that, we use a dot system. First, you write the name of the object, then the property you want to access and
            then the information inside that property for example, if you have an object that holds a list of people and
            information about them you could write objectname.grace.age and it would give you the age of grace.

        </p>

        <p>Now last but not least a little on Javascript functions. Javascript functions are great because they are a
            way of creating a little package of instructions that won't get used until you call it. The great thing
            about functions is that you can reuse that little package of instructions as many times as you like
            throughout the code. This is a MASSIVE time saver.
