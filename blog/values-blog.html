            An exploration of values, identity and stregths
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing about values and identity is something that feels a little challenging for me. I know what my values
            are but putting them into writing they look a little weak in their stature, or that it could be too simple
            to long for safety. Not just safety from harm but for the world to be a safe place for ALL of the beings
            that live here. or even that the planet itself can be safe. And not just safe but adored. That with this
            kind of safety comes respect and gratitude for the way we support each other and the way we inspire awe or
            action. Even the safety of knowing people will look after themselves and set boundaries, the safety that
            comes from living in a world where honesty is highly regarded.

            I know from experience that there are consequences from not being honest. Aside from the consequences that
            come from lying there are large ones from simply not being one's self, not allowing the world to know you
            and judge, I want to live in a world where we know its ok if we are not liked by everyone, that people will
            love us and people will judge us and that is just life.

        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I know I must mention here is that there are many more values I have. I've dived deep into safety
            because it is connected to so many arias of life. One more that I will mention is clean water. Clean water
            for me is a key to so many things. What would the world be like if clean water was the biggest priority? It
            would perhaps be impossible to treat each other and the planet the way we do. Pondering inequality, perhaps
            there would not be the same room for inequality to grow and fester. At the very least there would be some
            change in health inequality as we know places with less wealth also end up with more contaminated water.

            Identity. I am confused by existence and that I am in it (right now, sometimes this is perfectly
            comfortable). What I can say is I place myself in the world as a human that loves poetry and nature. I
            sometimes have big feelings, both the kinds we call “good” and ‘bad’ I try not to judge them as such. I have
            travelled but ultimately come from a small place called Waiomu, this place has shaped me more than any
            other, with its small streams, bush-covered hills and tasty water. It is the most beautiful thing I know- in
            that I can say I know it, and it knows me. I see myself as being lucky to have such a place.

            My strengths and weaknesses are numerous. I am brave in my honesty. I am curious and excitable. I am
            distractible and shy. I tend to make myself small around people I don't know. I am funny and tenacious. I
            can navigate conflict and listen with compassion. I am easily frustrated and want to be good at things right
            away. My emotions can become acute. I am sensitive, adaptable and fond of learning new things. There are
            more but ill leave it at that for now,
