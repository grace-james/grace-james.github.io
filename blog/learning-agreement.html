        <h1>Learing agreement bootcamp</h1>

        <p> My long term career pam and pathway is to be able to make a good amount of money and not have to work all
            the time
        </p>
        <p>
            I think my biggest strengths in Bootcamp will be my enthusiasm for learning. My commitment consistency as
            well as self-care. I think my biggest limitations will be getting distracted and absent-minded when I
            encounter a problem, finding the intensity of learning so quickly overwhelming, and getting frustrated with
            problems.

        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will likely be staying centred and grounded during the
            intensity of learning so much in such a short amount of time. I also think speaking in front of a group will
            be challenging as well as working in a team on something really difficult.

        </p>
        <p>Some non-technical skills id love to develop more during boot camp are working alongside others on problems,
            developing my growth mindset to be really central to how I see my life and work. Having a positive and
            empathetic outlook toward myself, others and also the world. Seeing challenges as opportunities to learn
            something new or even just exercise my capacity for unknown muscle.
        </p>
        <p>My expectations for the Bootcamp team is that they will treat myself, each other and the rest of the cohort
            with respect. That they will support me with my learning by being available to answer questions and help
            with dev academy related queries. I expect that they will be approachable and curious about the question I
            came to them with.

        </p>
        <p>My expectations for myself on Bootcamp is that I will show up and commit each day and each week to do my best
            to learn as much as I can throughout the 9 weeks. I expect myself to treat myself, the team and my cohort
            with respect. I expect myself to do the things I know keep me well resourced outside of Bootcamp so I can
            show up able to put my best foot forward. I expect myself to reach out for support from my classmates and
            the team if I need help. I expect myself to keep showing up for my learning through any resistance that may
            arise.
        </p>

        <h1>Learing agreement foundations</h1>

        <p>My long term career plan is to be working part-time programming and making enough money to do whatever I
            want.

        </p>
        <p>My learning strengths include doing what I say I will do, this is related to my value of integrity. Another
            strength I have is sensitivity which sometimes seems a weakness but in this case, I can use it to know when
            I
            need to take some time out or when I need to drink tea and keep at it. Because of my sensitivity, I can
            discern
            my needs easily. A big learning strength of mine is also celebration. I take the time to feel the wins and
            do a
            little dance it makes learning enjoyable and fun.
        </p>
        <p>My learning weaknesses include ambivalent motivation especially when things are easy but moving slowly.
            Another
            is comparison, which makes things way less enjoyable and increases a sense of stress. Another weakness is
            avoiding tasks that don't excite me. </p>
        <p>The human skill I'm most excited about developing is a growth mindset. I would also really like to improve my
            feedback giving as well as receiving skills. Another that I am always keen on working on is being gentile
            and
            kind with people, allowing myself to think the best of folks including when they do things that make no
            sense to
            me.
        </p>
        <p>I commit to workloads that I have the time to complete and will plan my time accordingly. If something
            changes
            and I can no longer complete the work in time I will let the people I am working with know immediately. If
            for
            some reason I am struggling with something I will reach out for support.
        </p>
        <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me I will take some time for myself to figure out what is
            getting to me, if its something external to myself I will double-check to see if there is anything that I am
            struggling with internally that could be blowing what I'm feeling out of proportion. When it's clear what's
            going on I will communicate with my team about it if it's relevant to them. I will try my utmost to
            communicate
            compassionately with those that I am working with when dealing with any heated topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I
            have been struggling with something I am working on and have not found answers using google and a sandbox I
            will reach out via slack to the foundations chat or to my facilitator.
        </p>
        <p>The main thing that i expect from the facilitation team is
            responsiveness.
