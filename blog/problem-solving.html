        <h1>Why isn't this working?!?!?!</h1>

        <p>
            Storytime! Once I got blacked from getting my code to work by missing a -1 in a loop. It was so freaking
            frustrating and I spent a long time trying to understand why I kept getting undefined at the beginning of my
            loop. So, I tried a few different things and kept going back to the simpler loop I had made beforehand
            trying to understand why that was working and the new loop was not. It took me a couple of hours of googling
            and waves of frustration mixed with hunger (I’d skipped lunch, I would not recommend this as a strategy!)
            before I reached out for help.

        </p>
        <p>

            I got onto the slack channel that hosts all my classmates and asked if anyone knew what my problem was. By
            that point I was so hungry and frustrated I needed a break, I took a moment to rest my brain and read the
            reply from one of my classmates explaining that .length starts counting at one but my loop starts counting
            at zero. Damn! I thought, of course, I raced back to my desk and tried it, to my relief it worked. Off by
            one error are very common! My brain now has an eye out for them. A big learning from this is one, to take
            breaks when I'm frustrated, it's important to cool off emotions to be able to focus. Another is that it's
            super helpful to ASK! Someone else probably knows how to fix what I do not, and it saves time to ask earlier
            when google just isn't cutting it.

            Storytime 2.0 Another time I got stuck using .toUpperCase() I was experimenting and had used it in the past
            but when I used the method nothing happened. I wasn't worried, I knew I could figure it out. So I googled
            the toUpperCase method and read about it. Immediately I saw it has a parenthesis after it to call the
            function! I hadn't added that little key, something I've been running into often, so I knew that was my
            issue. I added the parentheses and vala, it all ran smoothly. Something I learnt from this is that keeping
            my eye on how different methods are run is really useful. And taking a quick peek at syntax can provide
            insight quickly if that's where the error lies, it's good to start there- with debugging.

        <p class="italic">
            Reflection on problem-solving, a rating of my own confidence in arias of programming related problem-solving
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>

            Starting with pseudocode. This is an aria I am not proficient at, I've just started using pseudocode and I
            haven't yet been able to write a list of tasks that really represents what I end up needing to do. Because
            I’m really still learning how code works sometimes it's challenging to know what will work. I can get very
            carried away trying something I think will work for the solution I'm needing. In saying that I think writing
            pseudocode is a really good practice for me to start putting more useful plans together for myself.

        </p>
        <p>
            Next: trying something. At the moment this is one of my go tos, trying something is good because sometimes I
            get to a solution but other times I end up learning something on the way anyway, so it's a win-win. As long
            as I am using other techniques at the same time like console log to see if what I am trying is outputting I
            think it's really helpful for problem-solving and learning.

        </p>
        <p>
            Next: Rubber ducky method. I love this method and want to implement it more. I haven't explored using it as
            much
            as I would like to but I have noticed that when formulating my questions in writing to the slack channel I
            have
            had to really explain what's going on and just through that have thought of what a solution might be. This
            method is super helpful and I’d love to use it more
        </p>
        <p>

            Next: reading error messages. This method is great and I use it a lot for fixing syntax errors but it's
            taking me some time to understand how to read the message and know what the error is pointing to. This one
            I'm not too confident with and need some more time to learn how to use the error message reader.

        </p>
        <p>
            Next: console logging. This is my absolute favourite thing. I use this all the time to check if things are
            working or to see what the typeof something is. This is the thing I feel most confident using. It is super
            useful if a function not working and I need to find out where the bug is, I just move my little console log
            around and see where the function stops working. I love this technique so much!

        </p>
        <p>
            Next: googling, this is very important and I'm slowly learning how to use google when it comes to
            programming. I use google a lot but I can't say I'm super confident with it as I still sometimes get stuck
            with how to read about code and then conceptualize it. This can be simple but sometimes not, more learning
            is required in this aria.

        </p>
        <p>
            Next: asking peers for help. I am becoming more comfortable asking for help and learning new things from
            reading other peoples answers and suggestions. This is an area I tend to shy away from and I'm growing in at
            the moment through challenging myself to put myself out there and seeing what happens.

        </p>
        <p>
            Next: asking coaches for help. Yes, this is handy for things that I think my coach specifically will know,
            otherwise I like to use the foundations chat for questions as there are more folks there!

        </p>
        <p>
            And lastly: improving the process through reflection. This is coming to me more throughout these later weeks
            of foundations. I take time throughout the day to talk with my housemate about what I've learned. It's
            extremely helpful for solidifying learnings. I hope this is a habit I keep up and don't end up overlooking
            because I get caught up in moving to the next thing.
