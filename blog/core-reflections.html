        <p>
            Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego while learning core throughout foundations are: One,
            I love knowing I can change my brain through effort. I am so relieved to know my limitations don't define me
            and who I will be in the future. I can change, thank god. Two, I am resistant to meditation and my mind will
            go to great lengths to avoid doing it including the experience itself being unusually uncomfortable. Three;
            reaching out for help is challenging but 100% allowed and ok.

        </p>
        <p>
            The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming from where I'm standing is being
            able to manage challenges in a healthy way, being able to problem-solve from a well-resourced place and
            knowing ones self enough to let people know if you are struggling with something. Being able to show up to
            learning, to a team with the insight that we are all human and have things going on internally so holding
            each other (including ourselves) with gentleness.

        </p>
        <p>
            The thing that surprised me the most about the core learning was how exciting it was to learn about growth
            mindset and neuroplasticity, learning about them has changed my outlook on learning as well as mindset in
            general. I have really upped my game with self-talk and that's been incredibly helpful in my life in
            general. Not just with learning programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the reason EDA spends so much time focusing on core is because being able to interact with ones self
            and other people in a well-resourced self-aware way is so important for being a great person to have around.
            And being a great person to have around is what teams need, including in web development. Also, Bootcamp is
            hard and people can be less nice to be around when they are struggling so having empathy seems like a good
            thing for going into something that will stretch the limits of people's capacity.

        </P>
        <p>
            The time I spent learning core does not feel like a waste of time at all. I have started learning the
            invaluable skill of how to learn. That will be with me for anything I learn moving forward and that is
            precious af.
