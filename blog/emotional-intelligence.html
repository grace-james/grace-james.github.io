            How we relate to ourselves and others

            So what is emotional intellegence or EQ? It's not just one thing, it's a set of skills that help you
            navigate the social aspects of the world. emotional intelligence helps us listen and understand. It helps us
            discern which desision will be best, not just for ourselves but also for the collective. EQ contributes to
            communication, reading facial expressions, makeing friends, understanding our feelings and much more.

            EQ is important for success if you want to be a great leader, but more than that even it will help you
            understand yourself and the world. Emotionally intelligent folks are more able to understand what they're
            feeling, why they feel that way and how to manage their emotions. they are responsive rather than reactive.
            Emotional intelligence is important to look out for yourself and others around too. Having a high EQ gives
            important social skills like being able to respond to someone else's issues and support them with what's
            going on. As well as knowing when you need to take care of yourself first.

            It might be obvious how EQ and IQ differ by now. In some ways it's the classic street smart vs book smart.
            It's the difference between grasping complex concepts and grasping one life, this is a big call but I think
            it's true.
