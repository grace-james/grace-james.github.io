            An exploration of values, identity and stregths
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing about values and identity is something that feels a little challenging for me. I know what my values
            are but putting them into writing they look a little weak in their stature, or that it could be too simple
            to long for safety. Not just safety from harm but for the world to be a safe place for ALL of the beings
            that live here. or even that the planet itself can be safe. And not just safe but adored. That with this
            kind of safety comes respect and gratitude for the way we support each other and the way we inspire awe or
            action. Even the safety of knowing people will look after themselves and set boundaries, the safety that
            comes from living in a world where honesty is highly regarded.

        </p>
        <p>

            I know from experience that there are consequences from not being honest. Aside from the consequences that
            come from lying there are large ones from simply not being one's self, not allowing the world to know you
            and judge, I want to live in a world where we know its ok if we are not liked by everyone, that people will
            love us and people will judge us and that is just life.

        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I know I must mention here is that there are many more values I have. I've dived deep into safety
            because it is connected to so many arias of life. One more that I will mention is clean water. Clean water
            for me is a key to so many things. What would the world be like if clean water was the biggest priority? It
            would perhaps be impossible to treat each other and the planet the way we do. Pondering inequality, perhaps
            there would not be the same room for inequality to grow and fester. At the very least there would be some
            change in health inequality as we know places with less wealth also end up with more contaminated water.

            Identity. I am confused by existence and that I am in it (right now, sometimes this is perfectly
            comfortable). What I can say is I place myself in the world as a human that loves poetry and nature. I
            sometimes have big feelings, both the kinds we call “good” and ‘bad’ I try not to judge them as such. I have
            travelled but ultimately come from a small place called Waiomu, this place has shaped me more than any
            other, with its small streams, bush-covered hills and tasty water. It is the most beautiful thing I know- in
            that I can say I know it, and it knows me. I see myself as being lucky to have such a place.

            My strengths in terms of my learning and career development are conisitancy, enjoyment, being able to hold
            an overveiw perspective and self care. My limitations in terms of my learning and carrer development are
            that i can get discouraged and distracted. I can also be shy to ask questions and sometimes persist when it
            would be better to take a small break.

            My strengths that might help me in my learning journey are sesittivity, curiosity, and consistency. I think
            these skills will help with obstacles that come up by being able to be curious about the issue and get into
            ‘understanding it’ mode rather than just ‘fix it’ mode. My sensitivity will support me in knowing when i
            will be in better shape to show up for challenges if i have a little break. And the consistency will aid
            with continuing to show up when things are challenging.

            An example of when i was working in a group with others and there was resistance or tension is when i was
            going on a self organised learning journey with five other people to LA. Our group had some challenging
            social dynamics. At the time we mainly used avoidance as well as harnessing the time pressure to ignore our
            dynamic and get things ready. In hindsight I think it would have been better to delegate tasks and split off
            into smaller groups that were comfortable woring together to manage the tension. We could have also come up
            with a system where one person facilitated at each meeting so there was always one person guiding the group
            and keeping everyone on track.
