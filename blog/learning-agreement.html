    <h1>Learing agreement</h1>

    <p>My long term career plan is to be working part-time programming and making enough money to do whatever I want.

    </p>
    <p>My learning strengths include doing what I say I will do, this is related to my value of integrity. Another
        strength I have is sensitivity which sometimes seems a weakness but in this case, I can use it to know when I
        need to take some time out or when I need to drink tea and keep at it. Because of my sensitivity, I can discern
        my needs easily. A big learning strength of mine is also celebration. I take the time to feel the wins and do a
        little dance it makes learning enjoyable and fun.
    </p>
    <p>My learning weaknesses include ambivalent motivation especially when things are easy but moving slowly. Another
        is comparison, which makes things way less enjoyable and increases a sense of stress. Another weakness is
        avoiding tasks that don't excite me. </p>
    <p>The human skill I'm most excited about developing is a growth mindset. I would also really like to improve my
        feedback giving as well as receiving skills. Another that I am always keen on working on is being gentile and
        kind with people, allowing myself to think the best of folks including when they do things that make no sense to
        me.
    </p>
    <p>I commit to workloads that I have the time to complete and will plan my time accordingly. If something changes
        and I can no longer complete the work in time I will let the people I am working with know immediately. If for
        some reason I am struggling with something I will reach out for support.
    </p>
    <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me I will take some time for myself to figure out what is
        getting to me, if its something external to myself I will double-check to see if there is anything that I am
        struggling with internally that could be blowing what I'm feeling out of proportion. When it's clear what's
        going on I will communicate with my team about it if it's relevant to them. I will try my utmost to communicate
        compassionately with those that I am working with when dealing with any heated topics.
    </p>
    <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. Talk to the facilitator about this. If I
        have been struggling with something I am working on and have not found answers using google and a sandbox I will
        reach out via slack to my teammates.
